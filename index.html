          came in with a song that sounded great on the acoustic guitar.
          I forced him to play it on an electric guitar and really struggled to get the mix right.

            Android killed the Litchi - Tribute to Mark Knopfler
          </a>
          Here we are attempting something in the style of Brothers in arms by Mark Knopfler.
          <p>We have a 10 bar chord progression which is something like: C - C - A - F - C - C - A - F - F - F</p>
          I thought this chord progression might make it hard to realise that it is repeating and give a more continious feel to the song.

          Be advised the 5 bar chord progression, some extra creepy sounds and an extra fast shaker keeps things trippy.
          Oh yeah and beware the shred.

          Interestingly a midi bass with distortion, playing very short notes, sounds a lot like an 8-bit instrument.

          This song was inspired by a T shirt: "999 Evil when I do handstands"
          The idea is that there are nine bars of music, of which the chord progression should repeat nine times.
          Currently the song is still too short.
          Maybe one day I'll finish it.

              the silence marches on, to the beat of broken hearts
              a quite smile hides, the truth of the thoughts you keep inside
              eyes light up to hear, when words are said though incinscere
              the silence marches on, and the silent walk alone
          </p>
          <p>
              I never seem to know, of how much ive seen is what youve shown
              sleepless nights weave truths, and dreams tell me what you wanted to

          He taught me a lot in that day about how to use a digital audio workstation.

            Zero or One I'm Bad at Counting - Thank You Ramfest 2011
          </a>
          I really enjoyed Ramfest 2011.
          This is a Thank you to everyone who made it possible.
          I remember lying in my tent and not being able to go to sleep, because dubstep was playing until 7 am.  
          This was not a problem,  I actually rather enjoyed it.

            Zero or One I'm Bad at Counting - Stargazer (version 2)
          </a>
          This is the first song I recorded for my girlfriend.
          This was one of her favourite songs, that I used to play over and over on the guitar.

            Zero or One I'm Bad at Counting - Ringtone for a Hero
          </a>
          This is the first song I made using my Eleven Rack and Pro Tools 8 LE.
          The idea was that it should sound like intro music for an action series.

            Few and Far between - Echoes
          </a>
          This is first song we recorded.  
          We did not have any real recording equipment.
          Except for a microphone, guitar pedal and normal pc sound card.
          
          <h3>Lyrics</h3>

          <h4>Verse 1</h4>

          <p>
          I can hear your call, it echoes through the halls
          The slightest hint of sound, seeping through the walls
          More than I can know, this message from below
          Now silent was a voice, I heard but not by choice
          It's clear to me now, there's some-one else around
          I prove that I alive, by calling to you now
          I've heard this before, an echo of whats no more
          It's my own voice I hear, soon to disapear
          </p>

          <h4>Chorus 1</h4>

          <p>
          You leave me dying here, as I'm bleeding on the floor
          And I just have to ask, was it me you were looking for
          I hear you crying from the dark, I try find what keeps us apart,
          Your voice is starting to disapear, please take me away from here
          </p>

          <h4>Verse 2</h4>

          <p>
          You left me hear, with the quite fear, that there's something left unknown
          I could see the signs in your quite eyes, hoping for something more
          As you walk away with a final tear, cause theres no words left to say
          I'm left hear with one last beat, of what once was a broken heart
          </p>

          <h4>Chorus 2</h4>

          <p>
          I hear you crying from the dark, I try find what keeps us apart,
          Your voice is starting to disapear, please take me away from here
          You leave me dying here, as I'm bleeding on the floor
          And I just have to ask, was it me you were looking for
          </p>

      <h2>About</h2>
      I play electric guitar and fiddle around in a digital audio workstation.

          Post Rock is our goal. 
          <a href="linkedin.com/in/eduard-burger-791b6396">Eduard Burger</a>, and I try to write, record and complete a song in 4 to 5 hours. 
          Post Rock is an instrumental style of music, examples of bands include: God is an Astronaut and Maybe She Will. 
          Whenever you hear any shredding, that is not me playing the guitar, that is my Eduard.
          Our music is also available on most music streaming services, like 
          <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5JNcgCGMm3Td5blU4BIYBe?si=OdS8il_9TxSDljxByviSSA">Spotify</a> and

      <h3>Om te Neurie</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://mnrmuller.wordpress.com/">Andre Muller</a>,
        reads poems and short stories, most of which are written by him. 
        I make the music with some creative input from him. 
        Most the poems are Afrikaans, but he is not limited to just one language. 
        We typically record and make the music in 4 to 5 hours. 
        Ek dink ons kry 'n redelike unieke resultaat.

          This project includes me and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anton-hendriks-1b549514/">Anton Hendriks</a>
          who writes the lyrics, sings the songs and plays the bass. 
          We have also had several other temporary members, since 2007.
          Our music is also available on most music streaming services, like

          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/andre.young.940641">Andre Young</a>, 
          who also plays guitar, and I meet up on a Saturday or Sunday and attempt to write, record and finish a song on the day. 
          We choose a genre or a band from the 1960s - 1990s, which has some guitar, and try to write a new song in that style. 
          This typically takes about 5 hours.

      <h3>Totally Indie</h3>
      <p>
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karel-schmidt-b9b9703b/">Karel Schmidt</a> and I 
          wrote about 5 songs in 2008 on which we recorded nothing. 
          This was about a superhero who did not need to eat anything and had unlimited energy. 
          He was totally independant, but he also did not have any bad guys to fight.
