            It is hard to disconnect our self worth from our productivity, but we have other qualities.
            I really tried to keep the song peaceful, but I couldn't hold myself back with the piano.
            Also, first time I am playing bass on a track and used noise (rain) as a transition.

            Given the lack of variety of Christmas songs, almost any song with a bell will qualify to avoid too much repitition on the radio, unfortunately songs with bells are also very rare.

            I forced him to play it on an electric guitar and really struggled to get the mix right.
            The drums sound like Box Car Racer.
            It is version 2, since the mix in version 1 is even worse.

            Here we are attempting something in the style of Brothers in arms by Mark Knopfler.
            <p>We have a 10 bar chord progression which is something like: C - C - A - F - C - C - A - F - F - F</p>
            I thought this chord progression might make it hard to realise that it is repeating and give a more continious feel to the song.

            Be advised the 5 bar chord progression, some extra creepy sounds and an extra fast shaker keeps things trippy.

            Interestingly a midi bass with distortion, playing very short notes, sounds a lot like an 8-bit instrument.
            This song makes us think of playing quake multiplayer.

            This song was inspired by a T shirt: "999 Evil when I do handstands"
            The idea is that there are nine bars of music, of which the chord progression should repeat nine times.
            Currently the song is still too short.
            Maybe one day I'll finish it.

                I hear my thoughts calling out to yours again
                let me in, let me see, what you dream
            </p>
            <p>
                the silence marches on, to the beat of broken hearts
                a quite smile hides, the truth of the thoughts you keep inside
                eyes light up to hear, when words are said though incinscere
                the silence marches on, and the silent walk alone
            </p>
            <p>
                I never seem to know, of how much ive seen is what youve shown
                sleepless nights weave truths, and dreams tell me what you wanted to

            We wrote this song in 2005 with some heavy Muse influences.
            My then roommate wrote the drums.
            In 2012 we decided to record it just for fun.
            The drums are still my old roommate's midi drums just with some reverb.

            Playing another note on the previously delayed note can have quite an interesting effect.

            I ended up with something I did not like and was about to throw it away.
            My girlfriend convinced me to keep it and to her credit, it grew on me.

            In 2011 my friend came over and we wrote and recorded a new song in 24 hours.
            This was when I realized that making a song in day is a great way to make music.
            He taught me a lot in that day about how to use a digital audio workstation.
            I just played some of the guitar and watched him work his magic.

            I remember lying in my tent and not being able to go to sleep, because dubstep was playing until 7 am.

            <h3>Lyrics</h3>

            <h4>Verse 1</h4>

            <p>
            I can hear your call, it echoes through the halls
            The slightest hint of sound, seeping through the walls
            More than I can know, this message from below
            Now silent was a voice, I heard but not by choice
            It's clear to me now, there's some-one else around
            I prove that I alive, by calling to you now
            I've heard this before, an echo of whats no more
            It's my own voice I hear, soon to disapear
            </p>

            <h4>Chorus 1</h4>

            <p>
            You leave me dying here, as I'm bleeding on the floor
            And I just have to ask, was it me you were looking for
            I hear you crying from the dark, I try find what keeps us apart,
            Your voice is starting to disapear, please take me away from here
            </p>

            <h4>Verse 2</h4>

            <p>
            You left me hear, with the quite fear, that there's something left unknown
            I could see the signs in your quite eyes, hoping for something more
            As you walk away with a final tear, cause theres no words left to say
            I'm left hear with one last beat, of what once was a broken heart
            </p>

            <h4>Chorus 2</h4>

            <p>
            I hear you crying from the dark, I try find what keeps us apart,
            Your voice is starting to disapear, please take me away from here
            You leave me dying here, as I'm bleeding on the floor
            And I just have to ask, was it me you were looking for

      This is a log of music created by me and my friends.
      I play electric guitar and fiddle around in a digital audio workstation.
      Here follows the bands (friends) I have made music with in this log.

          Post Rock is our goal. 
          <a href="linkedin.com/in/eduard-burger-791b6396">Eduard Burger</a>, and I try to write, record and complete a song in 4 to 5 hours. 
          Post Rock is an instrumental style of music, examples of bands include: God is an Astronaut and Maybe She Will. 
          Whenever you hear any shredding, that is not me playing the guitar, that is my Eduard.
          Our music is also available on most music streaming services, like 
          <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5JNcgCGMm3Td5blU4BIYBe?si=OdS8il_9TxSDljxByviSSA">Spotify</a> and

        reads poems and short stories, most of which are written by him. 
        I make the music with some creative input from him. 
        Most the poems are Afrikaans, but he is not limited to just one language. 
        We typically record and make the music in 4 to 5 hours. 
        Ek dink ons kry 'n redelike unieke resultaat.
